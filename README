A couple of things:

Sorry I was late; I had dinner :-P

The code here is verified to work with g++ - I can't verify it'll work
in Visual Studio, but it definitely *should*

You may want to edit this to retain your current codestyle.

I want you to be able to learn from this, so I put some comments in the code.
Seriously, ask me if you don't get how something works.

END OF LINE.
